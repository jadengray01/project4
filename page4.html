<h5>Ancestors</h5>
<p>But then us blacks kill each other day and night not caring about what our ancestors went through to give us our freedom. My Fellow people it's time to stop the Violence, and Racism. What us Humans need to realize is that we constantly say Black Lives Matter, and yes I agree. But I honestly think that ALL LIVES MATTER. We are all humans just have different color skin. And just because we have different color skin, doesn't mean me aren't the same, because in reality we all are HUMANS. Don't treat people of color, without color, with some type of color such as asians, germans etc different.

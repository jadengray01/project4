<h3> Black Lives</h3>
<p> He was Trayavon Martin, She was Sandra Bland, He was Alton Sterling, He was Philando Castile, All black lives that have been lost. Yet we constantly say Black Lives matter, but we choose not to do anything. Well actually I take that back, we choose to start killing police to get back. It's almost as if we can't be smart, because in reality if we all really wanted to stop this "Racism Thing" we would stop it verbally. By using our freedom of speech. </p>
